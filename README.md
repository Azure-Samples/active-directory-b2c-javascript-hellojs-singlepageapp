### Vanilla JavaScript SPA using Azure AD B2C to Sign-in Users and call a Web API
------------
There's a newer version of this sample taking advantage of the **Microsoft Authentication Library for JavaScript**.

Check it out here: [active-directory-b2c-javascript-msal-singlepageapp](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-b2c-javascript-msal-singlepageapp)

If you really need a sample that uses the **hello.js** library for B2C authentication, you can navigate to the master branch, but please know that it's no longer supported.
